# 1. this script does not run baro-dg.sh because it requires
#    orders of magnitude more time / processing power
#
# 2. As of rev 1473 (Apr 27, 2011), this script takes ~45 min
#    on 4 nodes of blackrose (quad-core 2.8 Ghz AMD w/ 8 GB RAM
#    and Infiniband interconnect) => 16 cores total

# 3. Use "-t" or "-t $OUT_FILE" to output timing info (if not
#    specified, output to timing.out)
