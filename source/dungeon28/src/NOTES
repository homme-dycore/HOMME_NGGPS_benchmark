The following notes relate the the current status (3/14/2016) of OpenMP testing in HOMME:

The Intel flags used for compilation:

-DFORCE_Fortran_FLAGS="-assume byterecl -O3 -xAVX -ftz -g -I./ -no-prec-sqrt -no-prec-div -override-limits -qopt-report=5 -openmp -D_OPENMP -tracback" \
-DFORCE_C_FLAGS="-O2 -g -openmp -D_OPENMP" \

with the intel/16+ compiler

Which regions to perform OpenMP testing on is determined in the file: thread_switches.h

#define HORZ_REMAP_OPENMP 1
#define TRACER_REMAP_OPENMP 1

#define HORZ_PRIM_ADV_OPENMP 1
#define VERT_PRIM_ADV_OPENMP 1

#define EULER_STEP_OPENMP 1

The number of threads are determined from the namelists:
horz_num_threads             = 1
vert_num_threads             = 1
tracer_num_threads           = 1

The following tests have been performed with these results:

Experiment: baro2b

Case 1:
HORZ_REMAP_OPENMP  ; horz_num_threads=2  ; result=passes
TRACER_REMAP_OPENMP; tracer_num_threads=2; result=passes
HORZ_REMAP_OPENMP; horz_num_threads=2 and TRACER_REMAP_OPENMP; tracer_num_threads=2; result=passes

HORZ_REMAP_OPENMP  ; horz_num_threads=2  ; and 
TRACER_REMAP_OPENMP; tracer_num_threads=2; result=fails

Case 2:
HORZ_PRIM_ADV_OPENMP; horz_num_threads=2; result=fails
VERT_PRIM_ADV_OPENMP; vert_num_threads=2; result=passes

Case 3:
EULER_STEP_OPENMP; horz_num_threads=2;   result=under development
EULER_STEP_OPENMP; vert_num_threads=2;   result=passes
EULER_STEP_OPENMP; tracer_num_threads=2; result=passes
ULER_STEP_OPENMP; vert_num_threads=2 and EULER_STEP_OPENMP; tracer_num_threads=2; result=fails 


Primary issues:
Case 1:
  None

Case 2:
  2.1 The non-reproducibility is a result of communications.
  2.2 Moving the vertical dimension outside of compute_and_apply_rhs and
      higher up the call tree has proven to be difficult; the issue is
      understood and will be corrected once the communications issues have
      been resolved.

Case 3:
  The non-reproducibility is a result of communications.

Experiment: perfTestWACCM

Case 1:
HORZ_REMAP_OPENMP  ; horz_num_threads=2  ; result=passes
TRACER_REMAP_OPENMP; tracer_num_threads=2; result=passes
HORZ_REMAP_OPENMP; horz_num_threads=2 and TRACER_REMAP_OPENMP; tracer_num_threads=2; result=passes

Case 2:
HORZ_PRIM_ADV_OPENMP; horz_num_threads=2; result=fails
VERT_PRIM_ADV_OPENMP; vert_num_threads=2; result=passes

Case 3:
EULER_STEP_OPENMP; horz_num_threads=2;   result=under development
EULER_STEP_OPENMP; vert_num_threads=2;   result=passes
EULER_STEP_OPENMP; tracer_num_threads=2; result=fails

Primary issues:
Case 1:
  None 

Case 2:
  2.1 The non-reproducibility is a result of communications.
  2.2 Moving the vertical dimension outside of compute_and_apply_rhs and
      higher up the call tree has proven to be difficult; the issue is
      understood and will be corrected once the communications issues have
      been resolved.

Case 3:

N.B. The result=passes gives the identical result with the base case for the experiment.
